# Tissue Image Classification  

This project contains code to classify different tissue sample images to corresponding body parts. I have created custom model to classify images. I have also retrained pretrained models like VGG, Inception and Effiecient to classify images. The complete code along with t-SNE plots and reasons for misclassifications is available [here](./ImageClassification.ipynb).  

The summary report describing the paper **Deep Learning for Cellular Image Analysis** is available in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/127A_vtlYbI1TwUi0SjG73-7k6X9_Ni9-hlIYlzkKxRo/edit?usp=sharing).
